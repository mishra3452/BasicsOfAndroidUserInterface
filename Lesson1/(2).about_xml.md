**Layout**   
A layout defines the structure for a user interface in your app.   
All elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects. A View usually draws something the user can  
see and interact with. Whereas a ViewGroup is an invisible container that defines the layout structure for View and other  ViewGroup objects, as shown in figure.(We will see more about ViewGroup)

So, to make it very simple we can say that android uses certain type of technique called XML(Extensible Markup Language) to define all these type of Views and ViewGroups.Android provides a straightforward XML vocabulary that corresponds to the View classes and subclasses, such as those for widgets and layouts.    
You can also use Android Studio's Layout Editor to build your XML layout using a drag-and-drop interface.
